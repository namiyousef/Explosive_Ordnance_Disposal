# Explosive_Ordnance_Disposal
A C programmed robot that seeks an IR source, reads and RFID card, performs a checksum validation and returns back using the same path.

It's quite a shame that at the time of doing this project, I was not aware of 'git'. This has been added to my profile only recently and thus will have very few commits.

I will try to explain the context of the project here.

# Problem description:

"A suspicious device has been discovered in the Mechanical Engineering foyer at Imperial College London, South Kensington, UK. The area around the device has been cordoned off to a safe distance and the evacuation of people in the immediate vicinity has begun.
​
Very little is known about the device at present except that it is emitting an infrared signal and is probably set to detonate on a timer. An anonymous phone call to the police has led us to believe that the device has a remote disarm capability; however, the disarm code is stored on the device itself. It is too dangerous to send personnel in to retrieve the code and it is not known how long is left before the device triggers.
Your task is develop an autonomous robot that can enter the cordon, find the device, retrieve the disarm code and return the code outside the cordon."

This course required the design of a circuitboard and programming of an 8kB PIC18F4331 chip.

**Highlights of the project:** We had the lowest memory usage in class, at ~ 38% (class average being in the ~ 60s)

# Repository Contents:

### Files:

**ECMFinal.pdf:**
  A PDF of the final presentation for the project, showing it's highlights. I recommend looking at this for it includes some intelligent code reductions.

### Directories:

**projectFinal-3-5.X:**
  a directory that includes all the relevant functions and files for the project. This was exported from MPLABSx.
